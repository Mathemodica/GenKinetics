# GenKinetics

Modeling biochemical reaction networks with generalized kinetic formats 

## Library description

A Modelica library for descriptive modeling of biochemical reaction networks using a specific subset of enzyme kinetics referred to as simplified kinetics formats, e.g. convenience kinetics. These subsets of enzyme kinetics are represented by generalized structured kinetic formulas suitable for biochemical reactions with arbitrary number of substrates, products, inhibitors and activators. By utilizing the power of Modelica constructs for providing a compact implementation of such generalized structured formulas is presented.
